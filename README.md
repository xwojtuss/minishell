# MINISHELL

minishell is a difficult group project as a part of 42 curriculum. Basically - you need to create your own (mini) bash. The minishell needs to be able to execute external programs, our own built-ins, handle redirections and pipes, handle heredoc, environment variables, have proper error handling (wrong permissions, the files not existing, wrong syntax and so on...) all while behaving like bash and of course no crashing and proper memory management.

This project is a great way to understand how bash and other shell programs work. Once you are forced to understand in depth all functionalities I described you gain a completely new understanding of Unix-based systems as well as bash and other shell programs.

What's next? Transforming the minishell into a megashell! But that will happen later on in our programming journey :3

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running.

### Dependencies

You will need the readline library (libreadline-dev and libreadline)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/xwojtuss/minishell.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd minishell
```

3. Run the make command to build the project:
```
make
```

## Running the project

Just start our shell:
```
./minishell
```
Have fun and try your best to break it :)
